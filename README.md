# Hi, I'm Łukasz /wukaʂ/ 👋

Engineering leader with 20 years in tech — including 10+ years building and running high-performing teams across backend systems, infrastructure, fullstack, and operations.

I’ve built entire engineering departments from the ground up, growing teams from 2 to 10+ engineers and managing groups of 20+ including contractors. I’ve led distributed teams across time zones and domains (Europe, China, North America) and supported products at scale. I thrive in early-stage or high-growth environments, where structure and delivery discipline need to be built from scratch.

My experience spans telco, B2B SaaS, ecommerce, gaming, and AI-adjacent platforms. I’ve worked closely with product, marketing, and commercial teams — owning engineering delivery across full product lines and driving architecture decisions with company-wide impact. In one role, I led engineering for multiple internal tools powered by ML predictions, helping analysts and designers act on real-time insights. While the ML work was done elsewhere, my teams turned model outputs into real, usable products.

I focus on clarity, trust, and long-term resilience. My leadership style is calm and outcome-driven. I don’t micromanage or chase trends — I build teams that last and deliver consistently.

Currently looking ahead to **Engineering Director / Site Lead** roles — where I can apply my experience to help scale teams, create structure, and support meaningful product work with business impact.
