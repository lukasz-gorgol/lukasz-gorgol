# Hi, I'm ≈Åukasz /wuka Ç/ üëã

I have startup mindset and over 20 years experience in tech - half of that building and running high-performing teams across backend systems, infrastructure, fullstack, and operations.

I‚Äôve built entire engineering department from scratch, growing teams from 2 to 10+ engineers. I managed groups of 20+ including contractors. I‚Äôve led distributed teams across time zones and domains, across Europe, China, and North America. I‚Äôve operated as both a builder and a scaler: thriving in ambiguous startup environments, bringing order and structure to growing orgs, and owning delivery across full product lines - not just features. I worked closely with product, sales, and marketing leadership, made architecture decisions with company-wide impact, and acted as a business owner, not just an engineering manager.

My domain experience spans telco, B2B SaaS, ecommerce, gaming, and AI-adjacent products. In one role, I was group manager for multiple AI-related backoffice tools, managing fullstack teams that turned ML predictions into usable, business-critical interfaces - from real-time dashboards for analysts to scalable asset-generation tools for designers. I was responsible for engineering delivery end-to-end, even when data science was owned by other teams.

I‚Äôm calm under pressure and focused on outcomes. I value clarity, trust, and structure - creating space for engineers to do deep work without chaos. I don‚Äôt micromanage or chase trendy frameworks. I focus on long-term resilience, sustainable growth, and building durable teams.

I‚Äôve hired senior engineers in Warsaw and understand the Polish tech market, from compensation to cultural dynamics. I‚Äôm effective at bridging the gap between HQ expectations and local realities - translating strategy into delivery while maintaining team health and alignment.

I am open to build the local engineering hub from scratch, bringing structure, resilience, and a delivery mindset to a company crafting something meaningful, or as a co-founder to build engineering heavy product from ground.
